> Don't make friends, program them.


## General info
Need a language learning partner? Program one. This app allows you to create and converse with your custom made bot. Whether it's for learning or laughing, this site can serve a varitey of purposes.

## Inspiration
While learning Spanish, I used a lot of different apps that connect you to language learning partners. They would never be online when I wanted to practice. Now I have a partner that ready to practice when I am.
